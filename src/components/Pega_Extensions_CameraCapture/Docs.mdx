# Overview

The **Camera Capture** widget lets users take photos using their device camera and save them directly as case attachments. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for capturing, previewing, and attaching images to a case.

It provides a streamlined UI for:

- Starting the camera and previewing the live feed
- Capturing an image
- Retaking the image if necessary
- Uploading the final image directly to a case

#### Widget Configuration

This widget does not require additional configuration parameters. However, it relies on:

- **Case Info** from Pega:
  - retrieved using `getPConnect().getValue(CASE_INFO)`
