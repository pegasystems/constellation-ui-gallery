# Overview

The Card Gallery is similar to the Kanban board component except that instead of rendering a list of tasks grouped into different columns, it displays a gallery of cards in a responsive grid.
Each card will represent a case or data object. The list of cards to render is passed using a page list Data Page. The component supports the following features:

- Ability to create a new card through an action in the header by setting the 'createClassname' property
- Tasks are rendered using a details view and not hardcoded inside the component, which allows to use visible when and other features to personalize the content of the card
- Cards can be rendered horizontally (from left to right) or vertically (up / down). The vertically rendering is similar to a masonry layout and will optimize the available space.
- The Card Gallery component is also compatible with dashboard and will listen to filter changes if the property 'useInDashboard' is set

Note: if 'useInDashboard' is true, the data page must be of type list - it must be 'queryable' and sourced from a Report Definition. Also the DP must return the following fields: 'pyID','pyLabel', 'pyStatusWork', 'pzInsKey', 'pxObjClass'. If you need other properties, you will need to update the code.
