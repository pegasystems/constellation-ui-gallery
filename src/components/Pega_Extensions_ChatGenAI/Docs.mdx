# Overview

The Chat GenAI DX Component allows to leverage Pega GenAI to help users of your application. To configure the component, you just need to pass
a page level Data Page that will receive the prompt(s) of the user as parameter and will send back as response the output from the Pega GenAI rule.

The component lets you set the height of the card - you can set a maximum height or let it expand indefinitely. You can also set a boolean parameter called 'sendAllUserContext' that let you decide if the user will send a single prompt every time,
or if the previous prompts sent by the user need to be sent to the GenAI rule in order to maintain the context and create a conversation. If 'sendAllUserContext' is set to 'true',
a 'reset' button will be displayed in the header of the widget and will let you clear the conversation and start a new one.

The storybook demo will simulate the answer from a GenAI assistant. If you are running the storybook example from your local machine, you can implement your own API to connect to other LLM models and generate real response.
Look at the variable 'simulateGenAIResponse' for an example of how to do this.
