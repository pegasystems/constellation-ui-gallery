# Overview

Japanese input component has the following features.

- Lowercase to Uppercase  
  Converts Lowercase to Uppercase, for when the client inputs lowercase and the internal character handles it as uppercase.
- Hiragana to Katakana  
  Japanese has two types of characters, Hiragana and Katakana, which correspond one-to-one. Hiragana input is converted to Katakana.
- Full-width to Half-width  
  In Japanese, characters are generally handled as multi-byte full-width characters rather than single-byte half-width characters, and for this reason Japanese keyboards have a function to input characters in full-width. Some full-width characters have the same meaning in half-width, and these are converted from full-width to half-width.
- Japanese Era to Gregorian  
  Converts "Wareki" (Japanese calendar dates) to "Seireki" (Gregorian calendar dates). For example, "平成元年1月" will be converted to "1989年1月".
- Gregorian to Japanese Era  
  Converts "Seireki" (Gregorian calendar dates) to "Wareki" (Japanese calendar dates). For example, "1989年1月" will be converted to "平成元年1月".
