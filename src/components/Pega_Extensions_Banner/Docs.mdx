# Overview

The Banner widget can render messages for a case view - edit the pyStage view and insert this widget. Pass a Data page name that will be called
everytime the assignment is submitted. Your DP is a list DP that will support the pyID parameter. You can return a list of messages in the pxResults embedded object
using the pyDescription property.

The banner can be dismissed if 'dismissible' is set to true. There are 2 ways to configure the dismiss action:

- through a case wide action - in this case, set the dismissAction with the ID of the flow action - Your flow action can perform some post-processing and update the case data
- through an extra parameter called on the data page - in this case do not set any value to dismissAction - in this case, the DP needs to update the case and perform the update directly

After the action is perform, the component will automatically refresh the case view to show the updated values.
