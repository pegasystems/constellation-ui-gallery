# Overview

The Calendar widget allows to view a list of cases in a calendar view. The component supports the following functionality:

- 3 types of views are supported by default: Monthly, Weekly and Daily - Weekly and Daily shows an hour timeline whereas Monthly only show the day.
- Monthly view render the appointment as large card with field values whereas Weekly and Daily only render the title of the appointment (pyLabel)
- For hourly views - the range is from 7 AM to 7 PM - this is not configurable but could easily be exposed as settings
- The widget will listen to filter change on the UI (change month, view...) - it will persist the context in localstorage and on load of the UI, it will use the context from the localstorage if present - this allows to navigate between pages but maintain the selected view
- The widget will listen to ASSIGNMENT_SUBMISSION event from the Constellation runtime - if the case is edited using the preview panel, the calendar data will be refreshed automatically

#### Widget configuration

- The widget is configured by passing a **list Data page** that provides all the instances of this case type.
- Another parameter called **Create case className** will show the **Create** button if this parameter is set and let you create new case directly from the calendar.
- The component provides a **configuration option** to map date and time field names to different properties from the data page.
  This configuration is **optional** — if you don’t provide custom values, the widget will use the following default property names:
  - **SessionDate**
  - **StartTime**
  - **EndTime**
