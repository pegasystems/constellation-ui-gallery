# Jaw Layout

The **Jaw Layout** component displays teeth in a dental arch, allowing users to view and update tooth statuses interactively. It is designed for use in Pega Constellation applications and supports localization, accessibility, and status legends.

<Controls />

## Configuration

To use this component in a Pega application, you first need a Data Object to represent a single tooth. For this example, we'll call it `Tooth`. This `Tooth` data object should have a text property to hold the tooth's status (e.g., a `Status` field).

Next, in your Case Type, create a new field and define it as a `Field group (list)` using the `Tooth` data object as its source. This will create an embedded list of `Tooth` data objects.

Finally, create a new view and select the **Jaw Layout** template. In the view's content area ("Region A"), place the `Field group (list)` property you just created. The component is designed to automatically read the `Status` field from each entry in the list to render the dental chart. The `index.tsx` file for this component specifically extracts the `status` property from the provided data to display the tooth statuses.

## Features
