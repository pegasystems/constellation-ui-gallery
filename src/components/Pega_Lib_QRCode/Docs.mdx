# Overview

The QRCode field will let you generate a QRCode. The field property associated with the component will store a base64 svg image of the QRcode.
If the component is inside a form and editable, it is possible to enter an input property that will be used to generate the QRCode on the client.
If the component is marked as readonly, the field property will render the barcode image directly.
You need to make sure that the field property is of type text and is long enough to store a complete base64 image (set the length to 50000).

If you can want display the QRCode inside a createPDF shape, you can pass the text field as an image inside the section rule configured to generate the PDF.
