# Overview

Render an embedded data list as an editable table - While the recommendation is to use the OOB component to edit an embedded data list, this example showcase how to implement the same functionality using a Constellation DX component.

The component supports the following functionality:

- add, delete rows, update fields
- 1st column is frozen
- cell rendering is delegated to Constellation using createComponent.

<Primary />

# Configuration

To use this component, create a new view - use this layout template and in the region fields, drill down and select all the fields in your embedded data list
